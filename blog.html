				<h3 class="subtitle">After Will Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock at the Oscars, memes about the actor have resurfaced.</h3>
				<p class="content_description">Albert Marin has taken some very specific vacations. In Wales, he visited Raglan Castle to snap pictures of its stone wall. At the Palau Güell in Barcelona, he took meticulous photos, not of the building itself, but of the marble floor and its unique veins.<br><br>
					His trips followed in the steps of Capcom, which put bits of real-world architecture found across Europe into Resident Evil 4, which was originally released over 16 years ago. “I collected a great number of locations the game’s developers use as source material,” Marin told The Verge.

				<h3 class="subtitle">Trafficking, extortionate prices and rampant capitalism – has 'Animal Crossing: New Horizons' succumbed to the dark side?</h3>
				<p class="content_description">I’m scared to go back to my town in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I put the game down one day in late March and I haven’t been back. Of course, I’m worried about the weeds and my ninja rabbit neighbour Snake who’s probably been aching to tell me about his 
					workout regimen, that loveable little rascal. <br>
					Yet, as the pandemic has trudged along, I’ve found myself increasingly disillusioned with this – admittedly – great game. It wants me to check in every day, work to its schedule and meet its spectral standards so I can get a little dog with a guitar to come play ‘Wonderwall’ in my plaza.
