				<h3 class="subtitle">Capcom’s undying GameCube classic gets its greatest graphics overhaul ever thanks to two dedicated fans.</h3>
				<p class="content_description">Albert Marin has taken some very specific vacations. In Wales, he visited Raglan Castle to snap pictures of its stone wall. At the Palau Güell in Barcelona, he took meticulous photos, not of the building itself, but of the marble floor and its unique veins.<br><br>
					His trips followed in the steps of Capcom, which put bits of real-world architecture found across Europe into Resident Evil 4, which was originally released over 16 years ago. “I collected a great number of locations the game’s developers use as source material,” Marin told The Verge.

		<h2 class="main_h2">Elden Ring as an isometric, tilt-shift adventure game looks cosy</h2>
				<img class="article_thumbnail" src="/image/Elden-Ring-tilt-shift-news-cover.jpg" alt=""></a>
				<h3 class="subtitle">A different perspective on the Lands Between.</h3>
				<p class="content_description">As gorgeous as Elden Ring is, few would describe it as cute. Hold up, though, because if you apply a tilt shift effect to the Lands Between and view it isometrically, it actually does look kinda cute. Weird, but true.<br><br>
					YouTuber Flurdeh specializes in presenting the strange beauty of game worlds on their channel, and the latest video on Elden Ring is a special one. With an adjustment to the point of view, and the simulation of a tilt-shift lense—which tweaks the depth-of-field and various
					other qualities to achieve a miniature model effect—Elden Ring begins to resemble a dreamy CRPG, rather than the oppressive and dangerous game we've actually played.
