			<p>Will Smith, who slapped stand-up comedian Chris Rock at the 94th Academy Awards last night, has now become an internet meme — and not for the first time. 
				Rock was presenting the award for best documentary feature, and made a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, who has alopecia, saying she could be in "GI Jane 2" because of her shaved head. Smith then walked on stage and hit Rock in the face.
				During his acceptance speech for best actor, Smith apologized to the Academy for the disruption.

			<p>Uncensored pictures from the moment Smith hit Rock are being referred to as the latest meme of the actor. People are using the image of Smith swinging his arm to hit Rock to produce comedic edits of Smith playing fruit ninja or catching Pokemon. 
				Another popular meme format has edited the caption, "Me trying to enjoy the weekend" on top of Rock's face, and the word "Monday" on top of Smith, who is hitting Rock. 				
			</p>
			<p>Many Twitter users have reshared the slap image, asking how it has become such a widespread meme. One tweet which said, "How are there so many memes on Will Smith already," has more than 3,300 likes. </p>
