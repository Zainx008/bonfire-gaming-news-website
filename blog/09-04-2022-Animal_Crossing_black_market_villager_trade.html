			<p>I’m scared to go back to my town in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I put the game down one day in late March and I haven’t been back. Of course, I’m worried about 
				the weeds and my ninja rabbit neighbour Snake who’s probably been aching to tell me about his workout regimen, that loveable little rascal.
			</p>
			<p>Let’s talk about villager trafficking. If you’ve played New Horizons, you’ll know that you don’t get to choose who accompanies you on your island. In my case, I restarted because 
				there was an ugly frog called Diva in my starting duo. Judge me all you like, but this fickle approach to population control has spawned an entire industry, where people are laying down cold 
				hard cash to get the villagers of their dreams.</p>

			<figcaption>Images 1: Villager trafficking - Raymond</figcaption>
			<p>If you’ve been anywhere near the Animal Crossing Twitter in the past two months, you will have most likely stumbled upon Raymond, the heterochromatic cat dork who wears a waistcoat. At first, 
				I saw all the fan art and thought it was cute that this sweet kitty was getting so much attention. But the crushing reality behind his god-like status is so much darker than even I could imagine.</p>
			<p>If you’re keen to get a certain villager to live on your island, players can buy and use Amiibo Cards, but these only cover villagers from previous entries in the series. Raymond here is new to Animal 
				Crossing: New Horizons, and as such, you can’t just summon him into your game – he has to be found organically.</p>
			<p>Because capitalism demands it, entrepreneurial players have set up multiple means to mitigate the grind, resulting in websites like nook.market and, laughably, Nookazon. Both of these websites function
				 as online marketplaces where players can buy and sell everything from pansies to pandas, and yes, you guessed it… villagers.</p>
			<p>This capitalist nightmare has been big business for those lucky enough to own this special cat – all you have to do is annoy Raymond enough until he wants to leave your island.</p>
			<p>If you’re able to empty his proverbial litter tray, you’ll enter the part of the trafficking system where the villager is referred to as being “in boxes.” From there, you can proceed to gouge desperate
				 players for millions of bells, the in-game currency, or hundreds of Nook Miles Tickets, which allow players to travel to other islands. It’s led to many Raymond stans rushing to eBay to exchange serious capital for virtual debt to make up the difference.</p>
			<p>Once you’ve trapped Raymond in his house so there’s no foul play, you can set up a trade, where the crafty salesman opens up their island to the buyer found online. They drop their agreed bells and are then allowed into Raymond’s cell to liberate him from 
				his captor.</p>
